I chose to make vertices of differing radii, switching off between a radius of 0.5 and 0.7. It seemed to make sense at the time. However, I talked to a TA and he said I should try using vertices of the same radius. I tried to get it to work, but I never managed to get it 100%, so I stayed with what originally worked.
