This is my attempt to create a Jigglypuff with her eyes closed and singing.
If you couldn't tell, the object spinning on the right is a music note consisting of 2 cylinders and 1 sphere.
I tried to make the cylinder have the rainbow gradient like the other objects, but didn't get the functionality nailed down.
