The instructor's code will probably break mine; that is, if they were to fight in some kind of octagon arena death match.
I don't htink that code could actually fight in a death match, however, as I think they don't have very long arm.
Really, I just have to keep writing a whole lot of things in an effort to make my code stretch-out to its limits.
I'm really not sure if the limits will be tested this way, so I may just have to resort to simple copy-and-paste tricks... Here I go!ere I am trying to break my own code. I wonder how successful I will be at it. It is kind of difficult to imagine how the code will break, but I have no choice but to try.
