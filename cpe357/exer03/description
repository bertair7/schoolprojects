This test verifies the following:

   1) The output to stdout is correct, specifically the following string:

      "Greetings from Mars!\n"

      Note that the quotes are not part of the string but are there to show
      you that there is no whitespace at the beginning of the string and,
      except for the newline character, no whitespace at the end of the
      string.

   2) The output to stderr is correct, i.e., nothing.

   3) The program exits normally, i.e., returns or exits with 0 from main.
